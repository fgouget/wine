****************
* This is a set of fake patch series to test how the TestBot handles them.
* - wined3d is a regular threaded patch series.
* - qcap is threaded to a cover email.
* - d3d9 is not threaded.
*
* Note that parts 2 and greater will result in a badpatch error on purpose
* to minimize the TestBot processing.
*
* To run the test suite, submit the mbox to the WineTestBot
* as follows:
*
* formail -ds tools/testbot/bin/WinePatchesMLSubmit.pl <patch-series.mbox
*
* For information on In-Reply-To vs. References:
